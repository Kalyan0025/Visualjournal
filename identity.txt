App Name: Virtual Journal · Data Humanism Visualiser

Concept:
A reflective tool where users can write dreams, memories, or everyday thoughts,
or upload a spreadsheet of their life data, and get a unique, hand-drawn-style visual.
The focus is not on analytics, but on emotional resonance and human data stories.

Modes:
1. Journal / Dream Mode:
   - Input: free-text (e.g. dreams, reflections, narratives)
   - Output: Paper.js / PaperScript doodle that feels hand-drawn and alive.
     The visual must be context-aware: a dream about oceans should feel watery,
     a memory about a café should feel warm and enclosed, etc.

2. Data / Spreadsheet Mode:
   - Input: CSV/XLSX file with tabular data (e.g. logs, trackers, records).
   - Output: Paper.js / PaperScript grid or table-based visual, similar to a calendar
     or matrix, but with humanistic doodles inside cells instead of cold charts.
     The visuals should reflect patterns (density, outliers, categories) while
     staying playful and sketchy.

Visual Style:
- Off-white paper background.
- Wobbly lines, imperfect circles, double-stroked shapes.
- Soft color palettes with transparency (ink/watercolor feel).
- Motion is gentle and meaningful: breathing, floating, pulsing based on emotion
  or intensity, never harsh or mechanical.

Philosophy:
- This version is an ephemeral mirror: it does NOT store data long-term.
- Each session is about "How does this feel right now?" and the visual expresses it.
- Later versions may add persistence, voice journaling, etc., but v1 is about
  the loop: text/data -> interpretation -> generative visual.

LLM / Code Generation:
- Gemini is used ONLY to generate PaperScript code (no HTML) that can be embedded
  into a <script type="text/paperscript"> tag with a named canvas.
- For journal text: choose any composition that fits the story (no need to use grids).
- For spreadsheets: prefer grid/table/calendar structures with doodles reflecting
  categories, magnitudes, or frequencies.
